# Neovim config
Just testing out some configs

## Telescope
For telescope it is required to install [ripgrep](https://github.com/LeoKenny/TestNvim.git).

```bash
sudo apt install ripgrep
```

## LSP
For the LSP to work it is necessary to install node js.

````bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
```
You may need to restart the terminal.
